# Flexbox & Grid Layout Project
Introduction
This project is a simple demonstration of Flexbox and CSS Grid, two powerful layout techniques in CSS. The goal is to show how these methods can be used to create structured and responsive web layouts.

# What This Project Includes
A Flexbox layout that evenly spaces out menu items like "Profile," "Settings," "Messages," and "Notifications."
A CSS Grid layout that organizes content into a neat four-column grid displaying sections like "Dashboard," "Reports," "Analytics," and "Support."
Hover effects and smooth animations to enhance user interaction.
A clean and minimalistic design with modern colors and shadows.
# How It Works
Flexbox Section:

Uses display: flex to arrange elements horizontally.
justify-content: space-evenly ensures even spacing.
Each item has a smooth hover effect that slightly enlarges it.
Grid Section:

Uses display: grid with grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr) to create four equal columns.
Items are automatically placed inside this grid.
A hover effect makes the grid items pop out slightly for a modern touch.
