Grid Layout: Here, a grid with four columns is created using CSS Grid.
Key Features
Responsive Design: Both layouts adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.
Hover Effects: Items come to life with subtle animations like scaling and shadowing when hovered over.
Gradient Backgrounds: Each item features a vibrant gradient for a modern look.
Clean Typography: Modern fonts like Roboto and Poppins make everything look sleek and professional.
